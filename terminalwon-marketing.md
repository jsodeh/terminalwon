### Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline:**
One dashboard for all your dev terminals—accessible anywhere, even mobile

**First Comment (Maker Comment):**
```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built TerminalWON because I was drowning in terminals.

As a developer, I use Cursor for AI coding, Claude Code for CLI workflows, VSCode for legacy projects, and Kiro for experiments. Each tool has its own terminals, and I constantly lost track of:
- Which build was running where
- If Claude was waiting for my approval
- When tests finished
- What commands I ran yesterday

**The problem got worse when I stepped away from my desk.** I'd come back to find Claude had been waiting 20 minutes for me to confirm a file change, or a 2-hour build failed because I wasn't there to enter a password.

So I built TerminalWON:
- ✅ Unified dashboard for all your terminals
- ✅ Mobile app (iOS/Android) for remote access
- ✅ AI conversation continuity (continue Claude chats anywhere)
- ✅ Smart notifications (only when it matters)
- ✅ Team collaboration features

**What makes it different:**
- Works across 7+ IDEs/tools (not just one)
- AI-first design (captures and continues conversations)
- Beautiful, Cursor/Linear-inspired UI
- Actually works on mobile (not just a web responsive design)

**Free tier available** - Install extensions in VSCode, Cursor, or Claude Code and try it out!

Would love your feedback 🙏

P.S. For teams: We have shared workspaces, audit logs, and role-based access. Perfect for remote teams who need terminal visibility.

**Title:**
[Project] Built TerminalWON - Unified dashboard for terminals across VSCode, Cursor, Claude Code, and more

**Body:**
```
Hey r/programming,

I built a tool that I wish existed: a unified dashboard for all my dev terminals, accessible from anywhere.

**The Problem:**
I use Cursor for AI coding, Claude Code for CLI workflows, VSCode for some projects, and Kiro for experiments. Each tool has separate terminals. I constantly lose track of what's running where, especially when I step away from my desk.

**What I Built:**
TerminalWON - A central hub that:
- Aggregates terminals from 7+ IDEs/tools
- Works on web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop
- Captures and continues AI conversations across devices
- Sends smart notifications (command complete, error, input needed)
- Has team collaboration features

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js, Express, WebSocket, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Extensions: TypeScript, VSCode Extension API
- Mobile: React Native

**Open Questions for the Community:**
1. What other IDEs/terminals should I support?
2. Would you pay for team collaboration features?
3. Any security concerns with remote terminal access?

**Try it:**
Free tier available at [link]

**Title:**
TerminalWON extension for Cursor - Continue AI chats across devices + unified terminal monitoring

**Body:**
```
Built an extension specifically for Cursor users who:
- Run multiple Cursor instances
- Use Cursor + other AI coding tools
- Want to continue AI conversations on mobile
- Need to monitor long-running commands

**Cursor-Specific Features:**
- Full AI chat integration (capture and continue conversations)

Also works with Claude Code, VSCode, Kiro, etc. if you use multiple tools.

**Demo:** [GIF showing Cursor chat continuation on mobile]

Extension: [Cursor Marketplace link]
Free to try: [link]

Anyone else juggling multiple AI coding tools?
```

#### r/ClaudeAI

**Title:**
Built TerminalWON - Continue Claude Code conversations from mobile + unified terminal monitoring

**Body:**
```
For those using Claude Code (or Cursor with Claude):

I built a tool that lets you continue Claude conversations across devices. Start a coding session on desktop, continue on mobile.

**Why?**
Claude Code runs in terminal. Often you need to step away but don't want to lose context. TerminalWON solves this by:
- Capturing full conversation history
- Syncing across devices
- Sending notifications when Claude needs input
- Allowing continuation from web/mobile

**Also monitors all your terminals** (VSCode, Cursor, etc.) in one dashboard.

**Security:**
- Conversations encrypted end-to-end
- You control what's synced
- Can self-host

Free tier available: [link]

Who else uses multiple AI coding tools and struggles with context switching?
```

#### r/webdev

**Title:**
Show /r/webdev: TerminalWON - Monitor all your dev terminals from one dashboard (even mobile)

**Body:**
```
Demo: [GIF/video]

Built this over the past few months. Solves a problem I had as a dev using multiple tools (VSCode, Cursor, Claude Code, etc).

**Key features:**
- Unified terminal dashboard
- Mobile app (actual native app, not just responsive web)
- AI conversation continuity
- Smart notifications
- Team collaboration

**Tech stack:**
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite
Backend: Node.js, Express, WebSocket, PostgreSQL
Mobile: React Native
Extensions: TypeScript, VSCode API

**What I learned:**
- WebSocket scaling is hard (Redis pub/sub saved me)
- VSCode extension APIs have quirks
- Mobile push notifications are more complex than expected
- Users want dark mode (shipped both themes)

### LinkedIn Viral Strategy

**Content That Performs on LinkedIn:**

1. **Personal Founder Story**
```
6 months ago, I was drowning in terminals.

Today, TerminalWON has X,XXX users.

Here's what I learned:

1. Solve your own problem first
2. Launch imperfectly
3. Listen to early users
4. Iterate fast
5. Build in public

[Expand each point with 2-3 sentences]

What's a problem you're solving with code?
```

2. **Industry Insights**

The developer tools landscape is changing fast.

3 trends I'm seeing:

1️⃣ AI-first workflows (Cursor, Claude Code leading)
2️⃣ Multi-tool environments (no single IDE dominates)
3️⃣ Mobile-first developer experience (devs want mobility)

Why this matters: [analysis]

What tools are you using for AI-assisted coding?
```

### Hacker News Strategy

**HN Submission Guidelines:**

**Title Format:**
- "Show HN: TerminalWON – Unified dashboard for dev terminals across multiple IDEs"
- Keep under 80 characters
- Be descriptive, not promotional
- No superlatives ("revolutionary", "game-changing")

**Submission Timing:**
- Post at 8-9 AM EST (best engagement)
- Monday-Thursday (avoid weekends)
- Avoid major tech news days

**First Comment (Critical):**
```
Hey HN,

I'm the creator of TerminalWON. Happy to answer any questions!

Context: I built this because I use Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, and several other AI coding tools. Each has its own terminals, and I constantly lost track of what was running where.

Tech stack: Node.js, React, WebSocket, PostgreSQL. Extensions in TypeScript using VSCode Extension API.

Open to feedback on:
- Security model (end-to-end encryption, but is it enough?)
- Performance (currently ~50ms latency for terminal streaming)
- Pricing (does $12/month for Pro seem fair?)
- Features (what else would you want?)

Some technical decisions I'd do differently:
- Started with REST, should have gone WebSocket-first
- Underestimated mobile complexity
- Over-engineered the first version

Free tier available if you want to try it out.
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Reply to EVERY comment within first 2 hours
- Be technical, not salesy
- Acknowledge criticisms constructively
- Share code snippets when asked
- Offer to implement suggestions
- Don't argue with critics

## 🎯 Press & Media Strategy

### Press Release

**Title:** "TerminalWON Launches to Unify Developer Terminals Across Multiple IDEs"

**Subtitle:** "New tool brings VSCode, Cursor, Claude Code, and more into one accessible dashboard"

**Body:**
```
[City, Date] – TerminalWON, a unified terminal monitoring and control platform for developers, today announced its official launch after a successful beta period with over 500 users.

THE PROBLEM:
Modern developers frequently switch between multiple AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, and others. Each tool maintains separate terminals, creating fragmentation and lost productivity.

THE SOLUTION:
TerminalWON aggregates terminals from 7+ development tools into a single, beautiful dashboard accessible from web, mobile, or desktop. Developers can monitor long-running processes, execute commands remotely, and continue AI conversations across devices.

KEY FEATURES:
• Multi-IDE support (VSCode, Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Qoder)
• Mobile applications (iOS and Android)
• AI conversation continuity
• Smart notifications
• Team collaboration features

MARKET OPPORTUNITY:
With the rapid adoption of AI-assisted coding tools, developers increasingly manage multiple IDEs simultaneously. The terminal management space has remained largely unsolved, creating inefficiencies in modern development workflows.

AVAILABILITY:
TerminalWON is available now with a free tier supporting 3 active terminals. Pro and Team plans are available for $12/month and $49/month respectively.

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you've covered [relevant topic] before.

I built TerminalWON, a tool that's solving an emerging problem in the AI-assisted coding space: developers are now using 3-5 different AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) simultaneously, each with separate terminals.

INTERESTING ANGLES:
• The fragmentation of developer tools in the AI era
• How mobile-first tooling is coming to development
• The rise of "AI conversation continuity" as a feature
• Remote development workflows post-pandemic

We just launched with X,XXX users and growing X% weekly.

Would this be interesting for [Publication]?

Happy to provide:
• Exclusive interview
• Early access
• Usage data/trends
• Expert commentary on AI coding tools

Best,
[Your Name]
```
